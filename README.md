/* NOTICE posted 30 December 2019

I am archiving much of my old code from when I was first learning to program. The code in this repository is embarassingly bad, and it's not how I would write code to do something similar today. Please don't take this repository as an example of my programming habits and knowledge; look at my more recent repositories instead. */


# trig_fighters_videogame
Code and associated files for the videogame Trigonometry Fighters, by Dante Falzone.

It should be noted that Trigonometry Fighters does not require the player to know any
trigonometry at all. The game is called Trigonometry Fighters because it required
knowledge of trigonometry to *program*, not because it requires knowledge of trigonometry
to actually *play*. (Although I have put some block comments in the code explaining the
trigonometric aspects of the game, if you're interested to look.)

This game's dependencies include the Pygame module and the font $HACKERMAN (included
in this repository as `hackerman.ttf`. Provided that these are installed, the game
should be able to run on any system that can run Python, even Windows.

If you don't have Pygame installed, you should be able to install it with the
following command:

  `pip3 install pygame`
  
 To run the game on Unix-based systems (Linux and Mac OS X), open the
 terminal, navigate to the directory containing the game, and use the
 command `python3 ./space.py`.
